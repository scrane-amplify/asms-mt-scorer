# ECC Modeling Tool Scoring ðŸ’¯

Modeling Tools are activities that students do in Amplify Science middle school  units to create visual representations of their conceptual models for a phenomenon. The digital, web-based Modeling Tool activities task the student with creating a diagram that explains a specific phenomenon. In this project we develop and evaluate different approaches to automating the task of scoring student submissions. The goal is to assess complex constructs that students express as they engage with scientific phenomena in the course of the Amplify Science curriculum, easing the demand on teacher time devoted to scoring of student work and improve their decision making by giving the teacher actionable insights into their students' conceptual understanding.
